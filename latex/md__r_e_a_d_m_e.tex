This program does {\bfseries{a few prepared tests}} of quadratic equation and awaits user to {\bfseries{type coefficients}} to solve their {\bfseries{own equation}}

If you want to see the test, answer {\itshape yes} after start. Otherwise, answer {\itshape no} to skip forward to your pesronal equation.
